The diagram shows 5 classes representing the different levels of the hierarchies and 1 class for the courses, with a few child classes modeling different kind of courses. The property `partOf` defined in [OntoCIS Composition](../../composition.owl/documentation/index-en.html) is used to establish the relation between the hierarchy levels.

![Elective placeholders in the typical courses distribution](resources/image2.png)

During the development process for this model we identified a problem. The typical courses distribution used a placeholder to indicate when was it expected for a student to take an elective course. This couldn’t be modelled with the initial courses classes (Core_Course and Elective_Course).

![Instance for the “Elective 1”](resources/image3.png)

These placeholders had to be included since they hold important information, both for the students and to validate that the curricula matches some of the national requirements. So, a new class, called Placeholder_Course, was created as a child of Elective_Course.

For each course we set the following information:
* Term and/or year
* Knowledge area and group
* Amount of hours
* Credits
* Scores needed to get a partial or total credit
* Prerequisites
