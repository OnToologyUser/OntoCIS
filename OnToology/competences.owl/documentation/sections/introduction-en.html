This module includes every class and relation related to competences and learning outcomes.

This concepts can be defined as presented in [1]:

* **Competence:** a general statement detailing the desired knowledge and skills of student graduating from our course or program.
* **Learning outcome:** a very specific statement that describes exactly what a student will be able to do in some measurable way.

The important difference between these two concepts, is that a learning outcome definition must provide a way for it to be measured. Normally, a learning outcome will be a more specific version of a competence. For instance, a competence can be the “ability to implement algorithms and data structures in software”, while a learning outcome could be the “ability to implement basic numeric algorithms”.
