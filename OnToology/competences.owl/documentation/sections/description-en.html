The module is made from three classes, shown in the following UML diagram, and four object properties:

![Module UML](resources/image1.png)

As it’s shown in the diagram, we use the object property `partOf` from [OntoCIS Composition]( ../../composition.owl/documentation/index-en.html) to establish that:
* A competence is part of a category
  * A learning outcome is part of a competence

To define three of the four object properties described in this module, we based ourselves on the guide defined by [2]. In order to represent the level of contribution defined there with a numeric value (between 0 and 2) we create the following properties:
* **Develops:** this represents the value 2
* **Partially develops:** this represents the value 1

By transforming the courses-competences table created from the auto evaluation done on [2], using these entities, we can establish the relation between the courses and the competences. That way we can see which competences are developed in a course as shown in the following graph for Databases 1:

![Competences contributed to by Databases 1](resources/image2.png)

Or the other way around, see which courses contribute to the development of a competence, as shown in the next graph for C8 (“Understanding of what current technologies can and cannot accomplish” [2]):
