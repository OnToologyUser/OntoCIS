As it can be seen in the diagram, a relation between the custom classes and properties and some classes and properties defined by [FOAF](http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/) is established.

For instance, the image below shows the information for [Álvaro Tasistro](https://fi.ort.edu.uy/alvaro-tasistro-en):
