It’s used in two of the other modules of OntoCIS: the courses module and the competences module.

In the courses module ([OntoCIS Courses](../../courses.owl/documentation/index-en.html)), it’s used to describe the knowledge body organization and the typical distribution of courses as it can be seen int the image below.

  * A term is part of a year
    * A course is part of a term

While, in the competences module ([OntoCIS Competences](../../competences.owl/documentation/index-en.html)), it’s used to stablish the relation between categories, competences and learning outcomes as shown in the image below.
