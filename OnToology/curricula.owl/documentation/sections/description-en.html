The UML shows the complete ontology structure, displaying in red the relations stablished in this module by the following assertions:
* ** topics:taughtIn:** has Course as its range.  Therefore, a course can be taught in a course.
* **competences:contributesTo:** has course as its domain. Therefore, a course contributes to a competence.
* **competences:hasLearningOutcome:** has Course as its domain. Therefore, a course has a learning outcome.
* **degrees:requiredFor:** has Course as its domain. Therefore, a course is required for a degree.
* **professors:inChargeOf:** has Course as its range. Therefore, a professor is in charge of a course.

Given that the courses are the central concept in the ontology it isnâ€™t unexpected that the class used to represent it helps connect all the modules.

OntoCIS also imports all the modules to facilitate the instantiation of a curricula on a single file. All that is needed is to import this module, and the rest of the classes and properties Will be included.

![Classes and properties](resources/image2.png)

In total this module contains:
* 30 classes
* 21 object properties
* 11 data properties

![Course instantiation](resources/image3.png)

The instantiation of this modules allows us to access all the information included in the curricula. For instance, we can create a course graph, as shown above, with all the information defined in each of the modules.
